# App_ML_1
code from my Applications of Machine Learning coursework - kept for preservation purposes.


To run the code, unzip the bbc folder and start jupyter notebook and run the code with the "bbc" folder in the same directory. 

Execute code blocks sequentially.

*Note that the chosen model is in the last code block and that other models have been commented out,
 	but kept for preservation and discussion
